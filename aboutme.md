üíª: Currently a PD STA/Signal Integrity Signoff, Engineer at Qualcomm. Previously worked with Bharat Electronics and Lava International for multiple horizons of chip design.

üìñ: Obtained my MTech in Micro Electronics and VLSI from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, and my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from LPU, Jalandhar. My master's thesis project involved developing advanced methodologies for semiconductor design and IC fabrication focused on enabling low power edge AI inference devices.

üó≥Ô∏è: I enjoy working on semiconductor design flow, IC fabrication, and AI-enabled SOC design methodologies. In the past several years, I've become proficient in various EDA tools and programming languages.

üé±: In 2024-2025: I'm addicted (or scared) to AI, traveling/trekking at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates, and meeting new people :)

‚õ∞Ô∏è: The projects page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) resume, most fun stuff is classified though :-(

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
